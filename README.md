# WebGL Demo
This is a work-in-pogress 3D game engine written in pure JavaScript, utilizing the WebGL API. It will hopefully run on all platforms, support procedural generation and allow for modification of the terrain.
[A live demo](http://andreiziureaev.com/webgl-demo) will be available soon (if it's not already).
